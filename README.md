The __DPF Monitor__ is a compact device designed to monitor the status of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) in VAG group vehicles. The device supports engine controllers with the CAN UDS protocol (4-digit engines starting with Cxxx and Dxxx).

This device provides a real-time view of key parameters, enabling you to consciously manage the DPF regeneration process and prevent costly failures. It's important to remember that monitoring and analyzing these parameters is just as crucial as the regeneration notification itself. With the DPF Monitor, you'll be informed immediately when a regeneration starts, allowing you to avoid interrupting the process.

The device connects to your car via the OBD2 port, and all data is displayed on a dedicated screen. Itâ€™s the perfect tool for any driver who wants full control over their DPF's condition.

### Features:
- Readout of engine and DPF parameters
